# rusty-fork

This is a learning project in which I try to implement sporadic bits of PathOfBuilding functionality using Rust.
The looooong-term goal is to have a functioning fork of PoB built (almost) entirely in Rust.

All mentions of Rust, Cargo, or references to anything remotely reminiscent of those in this project are NOT and should never be interpreted as a sign or any indication of implicit or explicit endorsement or approval by the Rust project or the Rust Foundation.
